# Pytest naming convention -> any Pytest file should start with test_ or end with _test
# pytest method name should start with test
# Any code should be wrapped in methods only
# To run on command prompt -> py.test -v -s
# To run a specific test file -> py.test <file name> -v -s
# To run specific test methods -> py.test -k <method name or expression> -v -s
# -k stands for method names execution, -s logs in output, -v stands for more info metadata
# To run testcases that are marked (tagged) -> py.test -m <tag_name> -v -s
# you can skip tests with @pytest.mark.skip
# @pytest.mark.xfail -> to run TC without displaying output
# fixtures are used as setup and tear down methods for test cases- conftest file to generalize fixt
# fixture and make it available to all test cases (fixture name into parameters of method)
# datadriven and parameterization can be done with return statements in tuple format
# when you define fixture scope to class only, it will run once before class is initiated and at the end
